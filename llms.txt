## Active Personal Projects (2024+)

### SO-101 Robot (LeRobot)
Exploring robotics with the SO-101 robot arm from the LeRobot project by Hugging Face.

**Update (December 2025) - LLM-Controlled Robot Arm:**
Testing how well current AI models can directly control the LeRobot SO-101 using tool calls. Setup includes:
- Single camera mounted on the gripper for world perception
- Goal-based control loop (e.g., "pick up pawn")
- Direct model-to-motor control via tool calls

Takeaway: Current models are rapidly approaching embodied AI capabilities. The system successfully demonstrates vision-guided manipulation using only a wrist-mounted camera and natural language goals.

**First Hello World (September 2025):**
Initial setup and movement tests with the SO-101. Experienced motor burnout early on, requiring replacement before continuing development.
